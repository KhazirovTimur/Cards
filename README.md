# Cards
Cards in-hand mechanic in heartstone style
 
1. Load card art randomly from [https://picsum.photos/](https://picsum.photos/) each time app starts.
2. Fulfil player’s hand with 4-6 cards in a fan-way. (arc) The number of cards should be determined at random at the start of the game
3. Create an UI button at the center of the screen to randomly (-2→9) change 1 random value of 1 card.
4. Bind Attack, Health and mana properties to UI. Changing those values from code must be reflected on card UI with counter animation.
5. If some card’s HP drop below 1 - remove this card from player’s hand. (dont forget to     reposition other cards, use tweens to make it smooth)
6. Player can drag card and drop it on the middle of table (use drop panel of any size) Card moves back to player’s hand if it’s not dropped over the drop panel. Cards shines if its dragged
